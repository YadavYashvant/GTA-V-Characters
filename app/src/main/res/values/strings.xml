Unfortunately, his wife, Amanda, repeatedly spends his money and the family has became largely dysfunctional over the years. After getting on the wrong side of a Mexican Cartel leader, Michael is forced to return to criminal life once more, this time, aided by his protege and up-and-coming criminal Franklin Clinton. After his first job, he is joined by former friend Trevor Philips. Despite a rift in their friendship after several jobs, including stealing a superweapon from the government, raiding a county bank and a research lab for the FIB, they banded together with Franklin and Lester to pull off a final heist</string>
